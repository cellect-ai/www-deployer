# www-deployer (git deployer)

When working in this project, **read `AGENTS.md`** in this directory first for:

- What the service does and how deploy flow works
- Key files: `sites.json`, `app.js`, `manage.sh`, `templates/Dockerfile.default`
- How to add a new site, configure webhooks, and troubleshoot

Use AGENTS.md as the source of truth for config, paths, and procedures.
